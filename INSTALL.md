Currently, to run TripBlazer you must install PyQT4 (Python binding for Qt), 
download and unzip the TripBlazer source, cd into the source directory, 
and run "python main.py" on the command line. 

Instructions for installing PyQt can be found at: 
http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/installation.html

TripBlazer runs on Windows and Mac OS X. There is no binary/executable or installer available yet.
